Deep learning has revolutionised many fields, and music is no exception. Amethon first explored deep learning as a way to automate the composition process. After experimenting with a number of different applications, they came across neural music composers in 2019. They were struck by how much more depth and complexity the resulting compositions had than anything they had come across previously.

Deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks have allowed computers to generate music in ways that were once thought impossible. Amethon has been using these techniques to create unique and hauntingly beautiful compositions. 

Amethonâ€™s work is not only a wonderful demonstration of the incredible power of deep learning, but also a fascinating glimpse into the future of music composition.
