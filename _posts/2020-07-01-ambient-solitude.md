excerpt: A Zero Beat journey into solitude. Take a long, hot bath and turn the lights out.

<p>
'Ambient Solitude' is an album by Amethon, using deep learning to aid in the composition of music. It's an attempt to create Zero-Beat music, an genre that is completely empty, without any percussion or traditional structure. Amethon's music is a journey into solitude, taking you on a Zero-Beat journey through space and time. It's best experienced in a hot bath, with the lights turned off.
<p>
'Ambient Solitude' is a journey into the unknown, using deep learning to create music that sounds like it's coming from somewhere distant in space and time, with no clear source. This music is a soundtrack to the infinite unknown, and it will take you on a journey into the depths of your imagination.
<p>
The first track on Amethon's album is titled 'Solitude 45', and it uses deep learning to mimic the experience of being alone in the dark. It's a short piece, lasting over almost six minutes, and it sets the stage for the rest of the album. 
<p>
The second track is titled 'Sombre Reclusion', it's a more intimate experience, with just the sounds of a deep silence and a distant space. 
<p>
The pace slows with 'Solitude 20' as the intensity of your activity lowers, and the pace of your life slows along with it.
<p>
'Secluded Isolation' explores the vastness of space, the expanse of time, and the inner depths of the human mind. 
<p>
'Solitude 10' slows the album down even more, taking you on a journey into the depths of solitude. 
<p>
The sounds of life flow in and out of 'Serene Awakening', which then closes the album.
<p>
Now close your eyes, deep breath in, and relax. You don’t need to do anything. No one is watching. The world is quiet, and you’re alone.
<p>
