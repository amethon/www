excerpt: a meditative exploration of human isolation
---

As you descend into the dark and deep ocean, the water around you swirls and churns, creating currents that pull you deeper into the abyss. The shadows beneath the surface seem to dance and move, as if there are mysterious creatures lurking just out of sight. You feel a sense of mystery and adventure as you explore the unknown depths of the abyss, but at the same time, you also feel a sense of solitude and isolation in the vast expanse of the ocean.

As you swim deeper, the water becomes colder and the pressure increases, causing your ears to pop and your skin to tingle. The darkness surrounds you, and you can barely see a few feet in front of you, but you are drawn forward by the call of the unknown. You can feel the weight of the ocean pressing down on you, and you are reminded of the vastness of the abyss and your small place within it.

But despite the sense of isolation, you also feel a sense of peace and calm in the deep waters. The stillness of the abyss allows you to clear your mind and focus on the present moment, and you find yourself lost in the beauty and mystery of the ocean. As you explore the depths of the abyss, you are filled with a sense of wonder and awe at the complexity and majesty of the underwater world.

The album is a meandering exploration of the void, sometimes melancholic and sometimes hopeful, that offers a new way of understanding our shared humanity.

Drawing on influences from classical music and ambient electronic music, amethon has created a sound that is both transporting and deeply rooted in the present moment. The music is a means of exploring the depths and finding solitude, but it is also a means of expressing the infinite complexity of the human condition.

Through the music, amethon encourages listeners to slow down, to breathe, and to find stillness in the midst of the chaos. The album features a range of instruments, including swirling textures, ethereal synths, and expressive tones, all woven together to create a rich and immersive soundscape.

The track is both uplifting and inspiring, providing a glimpse into the possibility of finding light in the depths.

'fathom 2700' is a deeper, more spiritual exploration of the abyss, using both melodic and ambient textures to create a more introspective atmosphere. The track is more somber and intimate, with a contemplative mood that invites listeners to ponder the mysteries of the abyss.

<h2>My Story</h2>

I was always drawn to the ocean, and as a child, I spent hours watching the waves crashing against the shore and dreaming of what lay beneath the surface. As I grew older, I became more and more fascinated by the mysteries of the abyss, and I knew that I had to explore it for myself.

So, when I was given the opportunity to join a deep-sea research team, I jumped at the chance. I had always been a curious and adventurous person, and I was eager to see what the ocean had to offer.

The first few weeks of the expedition were exhilarating. We explored the deepest depths of the ocean, and I was amazed by the diversity of life we encountered. But as we delved deeper and deeper, I began to feel a sense of unease. The water around us was cold and dark, and I couldn't shake the feeling that we were being watched.

At first, I was terrified. I was lost in the darkness, with no way to communicate with the surface. But as the hours passed, I began to find a sense of peace in the solitude. I was forced to confront my own mortality, and I realized that I had to find a way to survive.

And so, I began to explore the abyss. I swam through the cold, dark waters, marveling at the beauty of the ocean. I discovered new species and ecosystems that no one had ever seen before, and I began to understand the true complexity of the abyss.

As I explored the depths, I realized that the ocean was a place of both beauty and darkness, and that it was up to me to find my way through it. And in the end, it was that journey that changed my life forever.
