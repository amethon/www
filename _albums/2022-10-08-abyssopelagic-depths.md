<p>

With "abyssopelagic depths," amethon seeks to bring listeners on a meditative journey into the depths of human isolation. The album is a meandering exploration of the void, sometimes melancholic and sometimes hopeful, that offers a new way of understanding our shared humanity.

<p>
Drawing on influences from classical music and ambient electronic music, amethon has created a sound that is both transporting and deeply rooted in the present moment. The music is a means of exploring the depths and finding solitude, but it is also a means of expressing the infinite complexity of the human condition.

<p>
Through the music, amethon invites listeners to slow down, to breathe, and to find stillness in the midst of the chaos. 

<p>
The first track on the album, 'fathom 2200', is a slow and deliberate exploration of the abyss. The music ebbs and flows, giving the listener a sense of being adrift in an endless depth. The track is both beautiful and unsettling, providing a glimpse into the vastness of the abyss.

<p>
The next track on the album, 'fathom 2400', is a more upbeat and hopeful exploration of the abyss. The music is brighter and more optimistic, giving the listener a sense of hope in the midst of darkness. The track is both uplifting and inspiring, providing a glimpse into the possibility of finding light in the depths.

<p>
'fathom 2700' is a deeper more spiritual exploration of the abyss, using both melodic and ambient textures to create a more introspective atmosphere. The track is more somber and more intimate than the previous tracks, creating a more contemplative mood.  

<p>
The descent to 'fathom 3000'  is a more contemplative exploration of the abyss. The music is slower and more reflective, giving the listener a sense of introspection. The track is both calming and thought-provoking, providing a glimpse into the depths of the human soul.  

<p>
The album ends with 'fathom 3200', a more introspective and contemplative exploration of the abyss. The music is slower and more reflective, giving the listener a chance to explore their own soul.
