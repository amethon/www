The music of Amethon is a meandering, sometimes melancholic, sometimes hopeful exploration of human isolation. It’s a search for silence, but also a journey into our shared humanity. The music is a means to an end, a means of exploring the void and finding solitude, but it’s also a means of expressing the infinite complexity of the human condition. Through the music, Amethon seeks to bring listeners into the silence, to immerse them in the abyss, and to share a moment of communion with the void. 

Deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks have allowed computers to generate music in ways that were once thought impossible. Amethon has been using these techniques to create unique and hauntingly beautiful compositions. 

Amethon’s work is not only a wonderful demonstration of the incredible power of deep learning, but also a fascinating glimpse into the future of music composition.
