- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp dried herbs (such as thyme or rosemary)
  
**Instructions**

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Once the water is boiling, gently place the lobster into the pot and cook for about 8-10 minutes, or until the lobster is bright red and the meat is tender.

2. While the lobster is cooking, prepare the lemon butter sauce by mixing together the softened butter, the juice of one lemon, salt, pepper, and garlic powder in a small bowl. Set aside.

3. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).

4. Cut the mixed vegetables into bite-sized pieces and place them in a large mixing bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with the dried herbs. Toss to coat the vegetables evenly.

5. Spread the vegetables out on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until they are tender and caramelized.

**Ingredients:**

- 1 pound puff pastry dough
- 4 medium apples, peeled and thinly sliced
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup butter, melted
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 pint vanilla bean ice cream
  
**Instructions:**

1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).

3. In a large, heavy-bottomed pan, heat the sugar over medium heat until it starts to turn amber in color.
4. Add the butter and vanilla extract, and stir to combine.
5. Lay the sliced apples in a circular pattern in the pan, making sure to fill in any gaps.
6. Place the puff pastry dough over the top of the apples, tucking the edges in around the sides of the pan.
7. Transfer the pan to the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the apples are tender.

**Ingredients:**

- 1 kg beef sirloin or ribeye roast
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 cup beef broth
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 4 tbsp horseradish
- 1 bunch of fresh parsley, chopped
- 1 kg of mixed vegetables (such as carrots, potatoes, parsnips, and onions)
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat your oven to 180°C.
2. In a small bowl, mix together the minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Rub this mixture all over the roast beef.
3. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the roast beef and sear it on all sides until it is browned.
4. Transfer the roast beef to a roasting pan and roast it in the preheated oven for 20 minutes per 500 grams of meat.
5. While the roast beef is cooking, prepare the horseradish cream sauce. In a small saucepan, combine the beef broth, heavy cream, and horseradish. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until it comes to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5-10 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened. Stir in the chopped parsley.
6. To prepare the roasted vegetables, toss them with the olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread them out on a separate baking sheet and roast them in the oven alongside the roast beef for 20-25 minutes, or until they are tender and golden brown.
7. Once the roast beef is cooked to your desired level of doneness, remove it from the oven and allow it to rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing. Serve the roast beef with the horseradish cream sauce and the roasted vegetables.
